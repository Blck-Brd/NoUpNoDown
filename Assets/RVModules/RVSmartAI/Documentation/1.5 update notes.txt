Made obsolete all old graph elements not supporting data providers. They will still show and have all fields untouched so you can refactor your graphs without
loosing any data. You will get errors at runtime informing you which graph elements needs to be replaced by which new equivalent.

ScanAndMoveToPosition and ScanWalkablePositions tasks scan distance field is now of type FloatProvider instead of float.
If you used those in your graph you will need to update those fields manually.
