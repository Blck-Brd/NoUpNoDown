This update change all scorers using curve logic: now input for method GetScoreFromCurve(float _score) should always be normalized (0-1) - earlier
it had to be unnecessarily multiplied by score, just to be divided by score in method GetScoreFromCurve(float _score). 
So if you have any scorers that inherit from AiScorerCurve, AiScorerCurveParams, AiAgentBaseScorerCurve or AiAgentBaseScorerCurveParams, 
to have the same behaviour as earlier you need to remove multiply by score in input parameter for method GetScoreFromCurve(), example:
earlier was:
GetScoreFromCurve(_parameter.ManhattanDistance2d(PositionToMeasure) / distance * score)  
now it will be:
GetScoreFromCurve(_parameter.ManhattanDistance2d(PositionToMeasure) / distance)  

It is now way more intuitive to write curve scorers properly, and we're also avoiding one multiply and one divide operations for every curve evaluation.
