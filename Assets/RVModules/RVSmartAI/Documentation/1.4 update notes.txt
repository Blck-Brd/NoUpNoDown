SmartAiExposeField is now obsolete. Every serialized property will be showing in inspector. If you dont want to show some fields, use HideInInspector 
or SmartAiHideInInspector attributes. SmartAiHideInInspector will hide field only in 'graph' inspector - when you select some graph element, while with normal, direct
selection of game object inspector will still show that field.
If you used SmartAiExposeField with description, you can easily recover them using replace feature in your IDE and replace all SmartAiExposeField
with unity's Header or Tooltip attributes in your code, as syntax is the same.
